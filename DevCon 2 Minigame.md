DevCon #2 Minigame

## Game Vision and Outcome  

When presented with the contract and tasked to create a short and small game for two with premade assets, as soon as a desert theme was recognized a wild west themed duel was natural. 

The idea had also evolved from a best-of-three into a "most combos wins" idea of completing as many combos in a 30 second span which made the game way more fun and felt like there was more chance for each player to take the lead from one another.
 
While we had several bumps and hurdles when it came to file management and needed to revert several instances of folders lest they'd conflict with global files. Aside from having to rebind several layer/tagged items in scripts most everything else went swimmingly.

As for the outcome of the game, due to its simplicity in functions and interactions with scripts and UI elements it runs quite smoothly with minimal error.

## Objective statement  

Players will feel *fierce competition and excitement* as they *compete to complete input commands* quickly to *fire at each other first*.  

## Controls  

With the directional controls already mapped to the corresponding directions we'd elected to only use the cardinal directions via the joystick to input the arrows that appear on the screen, and the button will always be at the end to finalize and fire.  

Action1 and Action2 are the buttons that sit adjacent to the joystick on the arcade machine and also show up as commands to input.

On a controller the analog stick is used to input the directions as it mirrors a joystick but the directional pad does not register for it. The Square button is Action1 and the X or Cross button is Action2 which work stellar.

Thus the controls are easy to understand, fair, and consistent in our game. There's nothing that will mix it up or change them around. All solid mechanics on behalf of players to input.  

## Design Rationale  

The desired experience to deliver is a rapid and exciting one where you test your reflexes and hand eye coordination against a friend in the simplest way possible due to the small data budget allocated per team. With the medium being an arcade machine the playstyle took heavy inspiration from fighting game inputs and combos, completing a sequence as fast as one can in that competitive space and spirit. Through iteration it became inspired by games like mario party where the competition goes on until the time runs out and enables players to really clash and take victory from the jaws of defeat from one another.  

It never really felt like a question as to why we chose it or if we should do something else, it just felt perfect for the project, like the vision was always there.  

## Roles  

Alice Bellefeuille - Technical Progammer - Alice was respoinsible for the randomization funcationality within the scripts to enable different inputs each time the game is ran and making sure they're recognized by the scripts and system to allocate score properly.

Yatharth Chopra - Technical Programmer and GDD Author - Yatharth took lead in programming the systems interactions to link everything together and player inputs to enable properly registering gameplay. He'd also reviewed the GDD for proper comprehension and delivery.

Elijah Francis - Designer and GDD Author - I, Elijah, took lead in designing the game and experiece with visual aids and thorough discussion and communication. I'd also took it upon myself to write the entirety of the GDD and produce the video for the project.

Honourable mentions goes to Allister Wylie who had helped us debug and finalize code and iron out bugs and problems within scripts.
